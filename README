This is a simple plugin that runs AStyle (http://astyle.sourceforge.net/).  The
plugin will only run on C/C++/C#/Java programs.  It can operate in two modes:
1. As a "save-hook" (to use emacs parlance)
2. As a command ("astyle_format")

Caveats:
1. astyle must be in your path
2. astyle will pull its config options from ~/.astylerc (see astyle docs)
3. Completely untested on Windows -- should be ok on both Linux and Mac as long
as you have astyle in your PATH

Sample keybinding:
{ "keys": ["ctrl+alt+f"], "command": "astyle_format" }
